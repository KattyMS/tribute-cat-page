        Cats have walked beside us for thousands of years—quietly, gracefully,
        and often on their own terms. From ancient temples to cozy modern homes,
        they have captured our imagination and love. This page is a tribute to
        the cat: a creature of elegance, mystery, and affection.

          <h2>Cats in History</h2>
          <p>
            In Ancient Egypt, cats were sacred. They were symbols of protection
            and were even mummified like pharaohs. In Japan, cats have long been
            considered good luck—especially the iconic <em>maneki-neko</em>, the
            beckoning cat often seen in shops. In Europe, they were both feared
            and cherished, associated with both witchcraft and royalty.

          <h2>Fascinating Cat Facts</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Cats can rotate their ears 180 degrees.</li>
            <li>Their purring may help heal bones and reduce stress.</li>
            <li>They sleep an average of 12-16 hours a day.</li>
            <li>
              Cats "talk" with their tails and eyes, not just their meows.

          <h2>Cats in Pop Culture</h2>
          <p>
            From Garfield and Hello Kitty to Salem the cat in "Sabrina" and the
            elegant Duchess in Disney's "The Aristocats", cats have found their
            way into books, movies, and even politics (remember Socks, the White
            House cat). Most recently, the Oscar-winning animated feature
            <em>Flow</em> (2024), a dialogue-free story about a resilient cat
            navigating a flood with other animals, captivated audiences
            worldwide and received the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature
            at the 97th Oscars—a historic first for Latvia.

        <h2>Why We Love Cats</h2>
        <p>
          Is it their independence? Their silent companionship? The way they
          curl up beside us or chase dust in the air? Cats bring a quiet joy to
          our lives, teaching us to observe, to rest, and to enjoy simple
          moments.
